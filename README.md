FOOD PREDICTOR CLASSIFICATION

A Convolution Neural Network Model for predicting various types of food. The original authors of the paper used Random Forest Machine learnig to generate their model prediction. However, in this repo I have constructed a simple CNN deep learning model using only 10% of training data from the foodvision 101 dataset and achieved a higher prediction accuracy of around 58% in comparision to the paper's 53%.
